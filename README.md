# Game Engine from Scratch
# A game engine developed from the ground up using the Xna framework and C#. The engine implements basic mechanics such as player controls and collisions which are presented through the 2 sample games.
# The peggle style game was for a final project while the Ping Pong themed game was an extra project done for honor's credit.
